This is the premier digidex client for iOS.

For more information on Digidex, please see http://www.digidex.org

This app is still a work in progress.



Add an Existing Card
--------------------

To add an existing card, tap the "+" icon in the toolbar. The "Bogus Card" button is a debugging tool that will pull randomly select one of several cards that are preset in the system.

If you know of a URL to use in place of a digidex card, you can enter that in the text field and then tap "Submit". Try this URL: http://digidex.org/digidex.json

Once the card is shown, you can tap "save" to save the card in your list.



Digidex Cards
-------------

The digidex card will automatically detect certain fields, like phone number, email address, or web link. These rows will be identified with an icon on the right side of the row, and tapping that row will result cause the application to take some action (for instance, compose an email or place a phone call).

If a card's content changes, you can force the digidex card to refresh by tapping the refresh icon.

To delete the card from your collection, tap the trash can.



Create a New Card
-----------------

NOTE: Any digidex cards created within the app is uploaded to digidex.bloviations.net, and assigned a random identifier. (Offline option coming soon)

To create a new digidex card, tap the compose icon in the toolbar, and then choose "Create New". This will allow you to enter any data you like. You may name each of the fields however you see fit. If you would like to add a new field, tap the "Add New Section" button, and choose the field type. You can select an image to use as the business card graphic, then click "Save" to upload and save to your collection.

To create a new digidex card from one of your existing contacts, tap the compose icon in the toold bar, and then choose "Import From Contacts". Once you choose someone from your contacts, all of the data from that contact will be converted into digidex format. You can select an image to use as the business card graphic, and then tap "Save" to upload.
